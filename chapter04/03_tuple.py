t=() # representing an empty tuple

# t=(1) #you might be thinking that this one going to represent a tuple with a single element but this is wrong bcoz python interpreter will consider this one as a number that enclosed with a round bracket
# print(type(t))

t = (1,) # this one represents t as a tuple with one single element
print(type(t))

a = (1,45,342,3424,False, "Rohan", "Shivam")
print(a)
print(type(a))
